# Introduction 1-20-26

Hey! I'm currently a sophomore studying CS and this is my personal website. I was torn between just building it myself vs using a static site generator, but ultimately settled on Jekyll because of the import statements, loops, etc. The header of the site is actually managed with a simply yaml file that I can keep updated with pages/links and the formatting is automatically handled for me. Not that it would have been any harder doing it by hand but hey, automating is fun!

In terms of my hobbies and interests, as much as CS consumes my life I'm an artist at heart. I'm always experimenting with different mediums and formats whenever I can.

One of my recent projects has been a sticky-note web app written in Typescript and React, with Next.JS as my react framework and MySQL as my database. It's been going pretty smoothly frontend-wise but the backend has been giving me some trouble. I originally chose the MongoDB toolchain as my backend, but decided it was a bit out of scope for what I wanted so I've had to migrate all of my API over to be SQL based as Mongo is all noSQL.

I've also been migrating over to Linux! Ever since updating from Windows 10 -> 11 on my desktop I've been having issues with bloat (Microsoft pushing their 365 subscription, copilot, etc...) Ultimately I think switching to Linux is the move. Especially considering that the Linux version of Steam comes with Proton preinstalled! The only two games (to my knowledge) I'm getting locked out of are Valorant and LoL because both of them use a Kernel level anticheat that doesn't have a linux counterpart. *shakes fist*

I've already set up [Nobara](https://nobaraproject.org/){:target="_blank"} , a fedora fork centered on media creation, on my backup laptop to see how I like it and it's been wonderful. It comes with Nvidia drivers preconfigured as well as all of the main media codecs already set up.

Welp, thats all I've been up to lately relevant to my tech sphere so I'll probably only make another post once something interesting happens.

Until next time...
